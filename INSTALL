(color wrapper was designed on GNU/linux.  but, cw is written 
in ANSI C and has been ported to several other operating systems. (see
./PLATFORM for supported operating systems)

what to do:

for installing globally(as root):
# ./configure && make install

for installing in your local home directory(generally non-root):
# ./configure && make installlocal

for only compiling the binaries:
# ./configure && make local


after the make "installocal" or "install" has been completed, please
view the README if you haven't already.

NOTE: if you want to install to /usr/ instead of /usr/local/(default)
run "./configure --prefix=/usr".  "--prefix" and "--mandir" are the
only configure arguments used, despite what the defacto (autoconf) configure
help says.
