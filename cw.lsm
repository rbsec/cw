Version:	1.0.16
Entered-date:	2010-06-20
Description:	cw is a non-intrusive real-time ANSI color wrapper for
common unix-based commands on GNU/linux.  cw is designed to simulate the
environment of the commands being executed, so that if a person types 'du',
'df', 'ping', etc. in their shell it will automatically color the output
in real-time according to a definition file containing the color format
desired.  cw has support for wildcard match coloring, tokenized coloring,
headers/footers, case scenario coloring, command line dependent definition
coloring, and includes over 50 pre-made definition files.
